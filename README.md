# Lab 1A:Create a simple C program to find the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.
### Step 1:
Use the Leafpad editor to write the C code. You can install Leafpad using the following command:<br>
``sudo snap install leafpad``<br>
Create a file named ``sum1ton.c``<br>

### Step 2:
Write c program to find the sum of the numbers from 1 to n.<br>
For an example set the value of n to 45.<br>
Save the file in Leafpad and return to the terminal.
```
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
  int sum=0;
  int n=100;
  for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
    sum=sum+i;
  }
  printf("sum of the numbers form 1 to %d is %d",n,sum);
  return 0;
}
```

### Step 3:
For the compilation of the code, use the following command:<br>
``GCC sum1ton.c``<br>
Make sure there are no errors.<br>
After compilation, an executable file is generated. Run this executable in the terminal to get the final output using the following command:<br>
``./a.out``<br>
![Screenshot 2024-08-07 215759](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66bd1819-3ec7-4192-99f0-54b03fa1e782)

The final output will be:<br>
`` Sum of the numbers form 1 to 100 is 5050.``
Check the output using a calculator to verify the result.

# Lab 1B:Compile the same C program using the RISC-V GCC compiler.
### Step 1:
To run the same C program file use the below command:<br>
`` riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o Lab1.o Lab1.c`` <br>
After compilation it will generate a file named sum1ton.o<br>
![Screenshot 2024-08-07 154120](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/11f8bea0-3719-4b5b-9c91-446d28cef16d)
### step 2:
To get the aasembly code run the following command:<br>
``riscv64-unkown-elf-objdump -d Lab1.o ``
We will get a large output of code, but we are only interested in the main section. To view just the main section, add | less to the previous command.
`` riscv64-unkown-elf-objdump -d Lab1.o |less``
![Screenshot 2024-08-07 154806](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fcef9a3-4598-479b-9efa-09ab9e3ea56b)<br>

After running the second command, we will get some output. Since we are interested in the main section, search for "main." We will see a bunch of instructions in the main snippet. To count the number of instructions, subtract the address of the first instruction from that of the next section, then divide by 4 (as the increment at each step is 4). This method reveals that there are 15 instructions when we are using O1. We can recheck this using a calculator as well.<br>
![Screenshot 2024-08-07 160155](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39208124-f050-4b7c-82f2-f789259dd133)<br>

Now, move back to the first terminal. Here, change the optimization level from `-O1` to `-Ofast` and follow the same procedure as above.<br>
![Screenshot 2024-08-07 160617](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc9393fe-82fe-4a1c-a19f-8b45debbcb6d)<br>

Here, if we use `-Ofast` instead of `-O1`, we get only 12 instructions. Therefore, the number of instructions changes with the optimization level.<br>
![Screenshot 2024-08-07 160729](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73b6bcaa-2ca8-4330-b5aa-4f5a1ff4257b)<br>
For `O2`, the number of instructions are 12.<br>
Using `-Ofast` reduces our set of instructions because this optimization level applies a broader range of aggressive optimizations. These optimizations streamline the code, eliminate redundancies, and leverage parallelism, resulting in a lower instruction count compared to `-O1`.<br>

# Lab 2:Running the Object File Generated by the RISC-V GCC Compiler with the Spike Simulator.
We will compile the object dump file using the RISC-V GCC compiler and check the output against the GCC results from Lab 1. This includes debugging the main part of the program and watching the register values after each step. By looking closely at these values, we can understand how the program behaves and how different compilation stages affect it. This helps make sure the compiled output is accurate and consistent across different compiler settings.<br>
1. For executing an object file created by RISC-V compiler use the below command in the terminal.<br>
```spike pk sum1ton.o```<br>
![Screenshot 2024-08-07 181544](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f145ba38-f692-426f-b639-862219a9da23)<br>
2. The following command will help us enter debugging mode using the Spike simulator:<br>
```spike -d pk sum1ton.o```<br>
Use the following command to jump to the beginning of the main section:<br>
``` until pc 0 0x100b0```<br>
![Screenshot 2024-08-07 182238](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0c1d00d-f2ea-481b-8111-2e21f3fe2823)<br>

3. To check any register value the following command is used:
   ```reg 0 a0```<br>
   Press enter to run the next instruction.
   Here the next instruction is ``lui a2 0x1``, which load upper bits of a2 by 01.<br>
   Intially value of a2 register is 0x0000000000000000.<br>
   After the first instruction it has changed to 0x0000000000001000.<br>
![Screenshot 2024-08-07 183148](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1021f417-9713-4e2c-bb46-ee4d9c1c7149)
4. The next instructions are:<br>
   ``lui a0 0x21`` which updates the a0 register value<br>
   ``addi sp sp -16`` This updates the content of the stack pointer 'sp' by -16 (or -10 in hexadecimal).<br>
   ![Screenshot 2024-08-07 185218](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd1798a5-9fdc-44e0-8bfc-d82f64d3793c)<br>
   In the above image we can see that intially sp value is 0x0000003ffffffb50.<br
   After the addi instruction sp value is 0x0000003ffffffb40.<br>
  We can recheck using the calculator. <br>

# Lab 3: Overview of RISC-V Instruction Formats.
The RISC-V architecture employs six distinct instruction formats—R-Type, I-Type, S-Type, B-Type, U-Type, and J-Type—each designed for particular operations such as arithmetic and logic processing, immediate value handling, branching, memory access, and jumps. These formats are crucial in specifying the 32-bit instruction codes that drive the RISC-V system.These formats differ in their structure and the kind of operations they facilitate. Below is a detailed breakdown of each format:<br>
![WhatsApp Image 2024-08-10 at 23 31 46_35a88ac2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63377927-7d1a-4f39-8c51-250e2d3f3a42)


### 1) R-Type (Register Type)
**Purpose:** The R-Type format is used for operations like arithmetic and logic that only involve register values. These operations don’t need immediate values or memory access, making them direct and efficient.

**Structure:**
- **Opcode (7 bits):** Instructs the processor on what operation to carry out, such as arithmetic or logic tasks.
- **funct3 (3 bits):** Works with `funct7` to specify the exact operation (e.g., add, subtract, AND, OR).
- **rs1 (5 bits):** The first source register that holds the first operand.
- **rs2 (5 bits):** The second source register that holds the second operand.
- **rd (5 bits):** The destination register where the result is stored.
- **funct7 (7 bits):** Used together with `funct3` to define the operation more accurately, especially to differentiate between similar tasks.

### 2) I-Type (Immediate Type)
**Purpose:** The I-Type format is used for operations that involve an immediate value (a constant within the instruction), loading from memory, and certain arithmetic tasks.

**Structure:**
- **Opcode (7 bits):** Defines the type of operation, such as arithmetic with an immediate value or loading from memory.
- **funct3 (3 bits):** Further specifies the operation, like adding with an immediate value or loading a byte from memory.
- **rs1 (5 bits):** The source register that provides the operand for arithmetic tasks.
- **rd (5 bits):** The destination register where the result is stored.
- **Immediate (12 bits):** The signed immediate value used in the operation, often for offset calculation or as an operand.

### 3) S-Type (Store Type)
**Purpose:** The S-Type format is used for store operations, where data is written from a register to a memory location. This is crucial for storing data in RAM or other memory areas.

**Structure:**
- **Opcode (7 bits):** Specifies the type of store operation, such as storing a word (32-bit) or a byte.
- **funct3 (3 bits):** Further defines the store operation, indicating whether it’s a byte, half-word, or word store.
- **rs1 (5 bits):** The base register that holds the address where the data will be stored.
- **rs2 (5 bits):** The source register that contains the data to be stored.
- **Immediate (12 bits):** The immediate value, split into two parts, that provides the offset to the base address for the store operation.

### 4) B-Type (Branch Type)
**Purpose:** The B-Type format handles conditional branch operations, allowing the program to jump to a different part of the code based on a comparison between two registers. This is key for control flow structures like loops and conditional statements.

**Structure:**
- **Opcode (7 bits):** Specifies the branch operation.
- **funct3 (3 bits):** Indicates the type of comparison (e.g., equal, not equal, less than).
- **rs1 (5 bits):** The first source register involved in the comparison.
- **rs2 (5 bits):** The second source register involved in the comparison.
- **Immediate (12 bits):** A signed offset used to calculate the branch target address. The immediate is split across the instruction fields and combined to compute the jump destination.

### 5) U-Type (Upper Immediate Type)
**Purpose:** The U-Type format is used for operations that require a large immediate value to be loaded into a register, often for constructing addresses or large constants. It allows loading a 20-bit immediate value into the upper 20 bits of a register.

**Structure:**
- **Opcode (7 bits):** Specifies the operation, such as loading an upper immediate value.
- **rd (5 bits):** The destination register where the upper immediate value will be stored.
- **Immediate (20 bits):** The upper immediate value that will be loaded into the register. The lower 12 bits of the register are typically zeroed out or combined with other operations.

### 6) J-Type (Jump Type)
**Purpose:** The J-Type format is used for jump operations, enabling the program to jump to a specific address unconditionally. This is essential for function calls, jump tables, and other control flow changes that require an absolute change in program flow.

**Structure:**
- **Opcode (7 bits):** Specifies the jump operation.
- **rd (5 bits):** The destination register where the return address will be stored, allowing the program to return to the point after the jump.
- **Immediate (20 bits):** A signed offset used to calculate the target address for the jump. The immediate is spread across multiple fields in the instruction and combined to form the jump target.

#  Lab 4:Visualizing Functional Simulation Results with GTKWave
In the provided Verilog code, the RISC-V instructions are represented with some variations compared to the standard RISC-V ISA. Specifically, each instruction type is assigned a unique opcode in the Verilog implementation. The `func3` and `func7` values, which are used to identify the specific operation, also differ from the standard RISC-V ISA. Notably, `func7` is employed to differentiate between operations involving immediate values and other arithmetic functions; if `func7` is not required for this distinction, it is set to 0 in the Verilog code. The table below illustrates how the 32-bit instruction patterns are hardcoded using these opcodes, `func3`, and `func7` values as defined in the Verilog code.<br>

## Hardcoded table based on the provided Verilog code

# Designing Digital Logic with TL-Verilog using Makerchip

### Logic Gates
Logic gates are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits, executing vital logical operations on binary inputs. These gates are crucial for designing intricate systems such as processors, memory units, and controllers. In digital circuits, logic gates work with binary signals, where "0" represents low voltage and "1" represents high voltage. They process one or more input signals to generate an output signal according to defined logical functions.<br>

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 093753](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28ddbce8-c199-4daa-93f3-fc8d0773913e)<br>

### Makerchip
Makerchip IDE is a robust tool for digital design, providing an all-in-one environment for coding, simulating, and testing HDL designs. It supports languages such as TL-Verilog, SystemVerilog, Verilog, and VHDL, offering a visual platform for real-time construction and simulation of digital systems. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive features, Makerchip is suitable for both beginners and seasoned designers. Makerchip enables efficient prototyping, debugging, and refinement of digital designs, ensuring that circuits perform correctly before transitioning to hardware implementation.<br>


### Transaction Level (TL) - Verilog:
TL Verilog is a contemporary extension of traditional Verilog, developed by Redwood EDA to streamline hardware modeling and design. It offers a more abstract and efficient syntax while maintaining compatibility with standard Verilog. TL-Verilog facilitates transaction-level modeling, simplifying the management of complex microarchitectures. In this method, a transaction progresses through the architecture, interacting with components such as pipelines, arbiters, and queues. TL-Verilog is especially effective in minimizing bugs and optimizing design, particularly when used with tools like Makerchip.<br>

### 5. Implementation of a Combinational Calculator in TL-Verilog
Overview of the Calculator: This section showcases a simple combinational calculator created using TL-Verilog on the Makerchip platform. The calculator performs the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.<br>
The resulting block diagram and waveforms are presented as depicted:<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8036afeb-76f3-486c-b4f6-52f5c8793583)

In this code snippet, two random 4-bit values, `$rand1[3:0]` and `$rand2[3:0]`, are assigned to the 32-bit variables `$val1[31:0]` and `$val2[31:0]`, respectively. The calculator then performs four arithmetic operations on these values.<br>

A multiplexer (MUX), controlled by the selection bits `$sel[1:0]`, chooses the result of one of these operations. The selected output is then assigned to `$out[31:0]`.<br>

## SEquential Circuits

A sequential circuit is a type of digital circuit that utilizes memory elements to store data, enabling it to produce outputs based on both current inputs and the circuit’s prior state. In contrast to combinational circuits, which rely solely on present inputs, sequential circuits incorporate feedback loops and storage components like flip-flops or registers to monitor their internal state. This internal state, combined with the current inputs, dictates the circuit’s functionality, making it capable of performing tasks that require a history of inputs, such as counting, data storage, or event sequencing.<br>

### 1.Counter Series:

The block diagram and waveforms generated are displayed below:<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b490f01-0945-4a28-bdc6-7237da52e88e)

### 3. Sequential Calculator:

This design is similar to the previous combinational calculator but simulates a real-world scenario where the result of the previous operation is used as one of the inputs for the next operation. When the circuit is reset, the result is cleared to zero.<br>

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 161837](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f901d7a-5ff6-4560-b804-d19da54cc1a4)<br>

## Pipelined Logic
In Transaction-Level Verilog (TL-Verilog), pipelined logic is effectively modeled using pipeline constructs that represent data movement through various stages, with each stage corresponding to a clock cycle. This method streamlines the modeling of sequential logic by managing state transitions automatically and providing clear, concise representations of complex multi-stage operations. This enhances both the clarity and maintainability of the design.<br>

### 1. Recreating the Design

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 162218](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71aff8b9-aa48-4c88-8c09-5ec86ce791fb) <br>


![Screenshot 2024-08-21 162446](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82066fc0-54a3-4944-bf7e-e13f830e1cb6) <br>

Therefore, it can be observed that the given pipeline design and the recreated design are identical.<br>


### 2. Pipelined Calculator
This design is similar to the previous Sequential Calculator but incorporates a pipelined architecture and utilizes `$valid` to clear alternate values.<br>

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 182420](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3d77f6a-a429-4047-a25c-72c2ff87646e) <br>

### 3. Cycle Calculator with validity
We introduce `$valid_or_reset = $valid || $reset;` as a condition for triggering calculations, replacing the previous method of setting `$out` to zero.<br>

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 175517](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1cf5b8d-fb89-4e1e-ac2d-cb1ace330c50) <br>

# Fundamentals of RISC-V CPU Micro-architecture
This section will discuss the implementation of a basic 3-stage RISC-V Core/CPU. The three stages include: Fetch, Decode, and Execute. The diagram below illustrates the fundamental block diagram of the CPU core:<br>

### Name of the clock signal is clc_asr

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 180115](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d26c27f-ed72-4cbb-abbd-53ab154c5dcc) <br>

### Implementation plan:
![Screenshot 2024-08-21 180155](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1e368ee-b8de-4819-b25e-11794e32706d) <br>

### 1. Program counter

The Program Counter, also known as the Instruction Pointer, is a component that holds the address of the next instruction to be executed. Typically, the program counter increments by 4 to fetch the subsequent instruction from memory. If a reset occurs, the program counter is reinitialized to zero for the next instruction, after which it resumes normal operation.<br>

The diagram below illustrates the functioning of the program counter.<br>

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 180439](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e2f298d-8e19-47f5-9315-9fbcebadc888)<br>

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 182158](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb85acd-7ddd-439d-98e1-505473fb965d)  <br>

Code:<br>
``` $pc[31:0] = >>1$reset ? 0 : ( >>1$pc + 31'h4 ); ```

### 2. Adding the instruction memory

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 181059](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ecf6c22-9838-4fec-88dc-c3eeef8ffad6) <br>

![Screenshot 2024-08-21 181120](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b07fa46-04bc-4358-96a4-6ce66fa87e05) <br>

The output of the Program Counter (PC) is fed into the instruction memory, which then outputs the instruction to be executed. The program counter increments by 4 with each valid iteration. This incremented output is used to fetch the next instruction from the instruction memory.<br>

The instruction memory provides a 32-bit instruction based on the input address. During the Fetch Stage, the processor retrieves the instruction from the instruction memory (IM) at the address specified by the PC.<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e08019d4-8349-4d62-a832-9e33b6fb0fdd) <br>

Code:<br>
```
     @0
         $reset = *reset;
         $clc_asr = *clk;
         $pc[31:0] = >>1$reset ? 0 : ( >>1$pc + 31'h4 );
         $imem_rd_en = >>1$reset ? 0 : 1;
         $imem_rd_addr[31:0] = $pc[M4_IMEM_INDEX_CNT+1:2];
      @1
         $instr[31:0] = $imem_rd_data[31:0];
```
### 3. Instruction Decoding 
The 32-bit fetched instruction must be decoded to determine the operation to be performed as well as the source and destination addresses. There are six types of instructions:<br>

- **R-type**: Register
- **I-type**: Immediate
- **S-type**: Store
- **B-type**: Branch (Conditional Jump)
- **U-type**: Upper Immediate
- **J-type**: Jump (Unconditional Jump)


The instruction format includes the opcode, immediate value, source address, and destination address. During the Decode Stage, the processor interprets the instruction according to its format and type.<br>
Typically, the RISC-V ISA features 32 registers, each with a width of XLEN (e.g., XLEN = 32 for RV32). The register file used in this architecture supports two simultaneous read operations and one write operation.<br>

         $imem_rd_en = >>1$reset ? 0 : 1;
         $imem_rd_addr[31:0] = $pc[M4_IMEM_INDEX_CNT+1:2];
      @1
         $instr[31:0] = $imem_rd_data[31:0];
         $is_i_instr = $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b0000x ||
              $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b001x0 ||
              $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b11001;
         $is_r_instr = $instr[6:2] ==? 5'b01011 ||

             $is_s_instr ? {{21{$instr[31]}}, $instr[30:25], $instr[11:7]} :
             $is_b_instr ? {{20{$instr[31]}}, $instr[7], $instr[30:25], $instr[11:8], 1'b0} :
             $is_u_instr ? {$instr[31:12], 12'b0} :
             $is_j_instr ? {{12{$instr[31]}}, $instr[19:12], $instr[20], $instr[30:21], 1'b0} : 32'b0;

#### 3b. Decoding logic for the other fields like rs1,rs2,funct3,funct7
In addition to the immediate field, several other fields also require decoding. The code for this process is as follows:<br>
Code:
```
         $rs2_valid = $is_r_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
         ?$rs2_valid
            $rs2[4:0] = $instr[24:20];
            
         $rs1_valid = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
         ?$rs1_valid
            $rs1[4:0] = $instr[19:15];
         
         $funct3_valid = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
         ?$funct3_valid
            $funct3[2:0] = $instr[14:12];
            
         $funct7_valid = $is_r_instr ;
         ?$funct7_valid
            $funct7[6:0] = $instr[31:25];
            
         $rd_valid = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_u_instr || $is_j_instr;
         ?$rd_valid
            $rd[4:0] = $instr[11:7];

         $opcode[6:0] = $instr[6:0];
```
At any given moment, only one instruction is decoded, and it may belong to any of the six instruction types. Therefore, it is crucial to validate the instruction to ensure it matches its specific category, thereby avoiding conflicts between different instruction types.<br>

#### 3c. Individual Instructions Coding
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4b9df4c-7a78-4de5-b5ba-2d3cdbfcc8eb)

To decode the individual instructions outlined above, use the following code:<br>
```
$dec_bits [10:0] = {$funct7[5], $funct3, $opcode};
$is_beq = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_000_1100011;
$is_bne = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_001_1100011;
$is_blt = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_100_1100011;
$is_bge = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_101_1100011;
$is_bltu = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_110_1100011;
$is_bgeu = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_111_1100011;
$is_addi = $dec_bits ==? 11'bx_000_0010011;
$is_add = $dec_bits ==? 11'b0_000_0110011;
```

We also need to update the program counter to handle branch instructions.<br>
```
$pc[31:0] = >>1$reset ? 32'b0 :
            >>1$taken_branch ? >>1$br_target_pc :
            >>1$pc + 32'd4;
```
output:

### 4. Register File Read and Enable
In this setup, instructions are fetched from the instruction memory and stored in registers. Two register slots are used to read these instructions, which are then sent to the ALU for processing.<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ec7b570-6887-418e-a20d-95f1790a4ad9) <br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69643cfa-bdb7-496a-bec6-42f567241580)

Code:<br>
```

$rf_rd_en1 = $rs1_valid;
$rf_rd_en2 = $rs2_valid;
$rf_rd_index1[4:0] = $rs1;
$rf_rd_index2[4:0] = $rs2;
$src1_value[31:0] = $rf_rd_data1;
$src2_value[31:0] = $rf_rd_data2;
```

### 5. Arithmetic and Logic unit
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faf1bbb4-2261-4693-8bdd-dcb163bf01af)<br>

Used to execute arithmetic operations on the values stored in the registers. The code for this is as follows:<br>
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57cd558b-85cb-4ff5-b927-228621ab9f23)
Code:
```
$result[31:0] = $is_addi ? $src1_value + $imm :
                $is_add ? $src1_value + $src2_value :
                32'bx ;
```

### 6. Register File write
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/016f9e12-9066-4434-bb66-7588924687bf)

After the ALU performs operations on the values stored in the registers, we may need to write the results back into the registers. This is done using the register file write operation. Additionally, we must ensure that no values are written to the destination register if it is x0, as it is designed to always remain zero. The code for this process is as follows:<br>

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d1301e1-2b73-45be-b4d0-29f37755ef35)
Code:<br>
```
$rf_wr_en = $rd_valid && $rd != 5'b0;
$rf_wr_index[4:0] = $rd;
$rf_wr_data[31:0] = $result;
```

### 7. Branch Instructions
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53e9d344-03a9-439c-b89f-3e9b9799c223)

Based on the control input, we might need to jump to a different address after executing a specific instruction, depending on conditions generated at runtime. This is managed using branch instructions. The code for this operation is as follows:
Output:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a09d5618-5fc1-431b-8d0f-83848c677e4e)

Code:<br>
```

$taken_branch = $is_beq ? ($src1_value == $src2_value):
                $is_bne ? ($src1_value != $src2_value):
                $is_blt ? (($src1_value < $src2_value) ^ ($src1_value[31] != $src2_value[31])):
                $is_bge ? (($src1_value >= $src2_value) ^ ($src1_value[31] != $src2_value[31])):
                $is_bltu ? ($src1_value < $src2_value):
                $is_bgeu ? ($src1_value >= $src2_value):1'b0;

$br_target_pc[31:0] = $pc +$imm;
```

## Testbench

To verify the correctness of the code, we use a testbench to check the implementation over the first five cycles.<br>
Code:<br>
```
*passed = |cpu/xreg[10]>>5$value == (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9) ;
```
Upon checking the log file we get the following result:

## Complete Pipelined RISC-V CPU Micro-architecture
The CPU core is pipelined to facilitate easier retiming and significantly reduce functional bugs. Pipelining is achieved by adding stages such as @1, @2, and so on. In TL-Verilog, there's no strict requirement for defining pipelines in a systematic order, which is an advantage of this approach.<br>

However, pipelining introduces certain hazards, particularly the "branch instruction hazard" or "branch penalty." This arises because branch instructions can alter the execution sequence, leading to uncertainties. The types of hazards include:<br>

- **Structural Hazards:** Conflicts over shared resources, such as execution units, can cause pipeline stalls until the resource contention is resolved.
- **Data Hazards:** Dependencies on results from previous instructions may lead to incorrect outcomes if the required data is not yet available.
- **Control Hazards (Branch Hazards):** Uncertainties in branch outcomes can delay the confirmation of the correct instruction path, potentially resulting in incorrect instruction fetches and performance degradation due to pipeline flushing.

### Valid signal for Pipelined Logic:
The TL-Verilog code to incorporate the valid signal for pipelined logic is provided below:<br>
```
$start = >>1$reset && !$reset;
$valid = $reset ? 1'b0 : ($start || >>3$valid);
$valid_or_reset = $valid || $reset;
$rs1_or_funct3_valid    = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
$rs2_valid              = $is_r_instr || $is_s_instr || $is_b_instr;
$rd_valid               = $is_r_instr || $is_i_instr || $is_u_instr || $is_j_instr;
$funct7_valid           = $is_r_instr;
```

### Handling Data Hazards in Register File with Bypassing:

```
$src1_value[31:0] = $rs1_bypass ? >>1$result[31:0] : $rf_rd_data1[31:0];
$src2_value[31:0] = $rs2_bypass ? >>1$result[31:0] : $rf_rd_data2[31:0];
```

### Correcting branch target path:
```
   //Current instruction is valid if one of the previous 2 instructions were not (taken_branch or load or jump)
   $valid = ~(>>1$valid_taken_br || >>2$valid_taken_br || >>1$is_load || >>2$is_load || >>2$jump_valid 	|| >>1$jump_valid);
         
   //Current instruction is valid & is a taken branch
   $valid_taken_br = $valid && $taken_br;
         
   //Current instruction is valid & is a load
   $valid_load = $valid && $is_load;
         
   //Current instruction is valid & is jump
   $jump_valid = $valid && $is_jump;
   $jal_valid  = $valid && $is_jal;
   $jalr_valid = $valid && $is_jalr;
    
    *passed = |cpu/xreg[14]>>5$value == (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10);
```

  <summary><strong>Lab 6: Comparing GTK wave and makerchip output<strong></summary>

# Evaluating RISC-V Pre-Synthesis Simulation Outputs with Iverilog, GTKwave, and Makerchip
The RISC-V processor was initially designed in TL-Verilog using the Makerchip IDE. For FPGA implementation, it was converted to Verilog through the Sandpiper-SaaS compiler. Pre-synthesis simulations were subsequently conducted using the GTKWave simulator.<br>

### Step 1:
Execute these commands to set up a development environment for working with simulation and synthesis tools, specifically for tasks involving Verilog and RISC-V.
```
sudo apt install make python python3 python3-pip git iverilog gtkwave

cd ~

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

python3 -m venv .venv

source ~/.venv/bin/activate

pip3 install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas
```




### Step 2:
To install the required packages, run these commands within a virtual environment:
```
sudo apt install make python python3 python3-pip git iverilog gtkwave docker.io

sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock

cd ~

pip3 install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas
```



### step 3:
Next, clone the repository into the home directory and create a `pre_synth_sim` directory to store the output.
```
cd ~

git clone https://github.com/manili/VSDBabySoC.git

cd /home/vsduser/VSDBabySoC

make pre_synth_sim
```


### Step 4:
Replace the `rvmyth.tlv` file in the `VSDBabySoC/src/module` folder with your RISC-V design from the Makerchip `.tlv` file that you want to convert to Verilog. Also, update the testbench to match your Makerchip code.<br>

To translate the `.tlv` definition of RISC-V into a `.v` Verilog file, use the following code:
```
sandpiper-saas -i ./src/module/rvmyth.tlv -o rvmyth.v --bestsv --noline -p verilog --outdir ./src/module/
```

### Step 5:
Now to compile and simulate RISC-V design run the following code
```
iverilog -o output/pre_synth_sim.out -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM src/module/testbench.v -I src/include -I src/module
```

### Step 6:
The simulation result, `pre_synth_sim.vcd`, will be saved in the `output/pre_synth_sim` directory.<br>
```
cd output

./pre_synth_sim.out
```

### Step 7:
To open the `.vcd` simulation file using the GTKWave simulation tool, use the following command:
```
$ gtkwave pre_synth_sim.vcd
```

### Pre-synthesis Simulation results:
- **clc_asr**: Clock input for the RISC-V core.
- **reset**: This is the input reset signal to the RISC-V core.
- **OUT[9:0]**: This represents the 10-bit output `[9:0]` port of the RISC-V core. It originates from RISC-V register #14.
